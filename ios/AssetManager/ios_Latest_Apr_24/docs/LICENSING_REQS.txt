Chandika – our attorney reviewed the zbar and github bar code scanner licensing info.  Please follow the attorney’s guidance highlighted below as it relates to the product development.  We’ll take care of the licensing implications.
 
GitHub - BARCODE SCANNER
 
·         Comply with the 4 items under the heading “What Do I Have To Do To Comply?”

From the license's "Redistribution" section:

1.    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
2.    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
3.    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
4.    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
A common way to comply, in a product that is delivered only in binary form and not source form (e.g. an application download) is to add a mention of the project, and link to its license (in our view, a link to the project website is ultimately also fine), in a "Help" or "About" screen of the application.

 
·         There’s no problem with using this library as part of a proprietary App that you license and/or eventually sell as long as you give credit and ensure that GitHub’s license terms still apply.

·         Will Cireson’s App add to or innovate on this library?  This is preferred by GitHub as they don’t just want you copying.

·         If the to-be-developed App is going to be licensed under the SLMA that we just finished wrapping up, we are going to need to refer to this project and provide a link to its license/website.  If there is going to be a separate license prepared for this App, be sure to refer to this project and provide a link to its license/website.

·         If Cireson is using “zxing” please note the additional requirements. – Please don’t use ‘zxing’ anywhere to keep this simple

·         Cireson should ensure that the user interface is modified so as to not cause confusion among users.  They are claiming trade dress rights in the “translucent rectangle, red line, and beep sound.”  Create a different user experience to differentiate.

·         Cireson should avoid naming the App anything that make also cause confusion in the minds of users between Cireson’s App and “Barcode Scanner.”  Arguably, “Barcode Scanner” as a trademark, is not very strong as it is very descriptive.  However, at this point, the developer would argue that “Barcode Scanner” has become distinctive through its use of the mark in connection with the App for years.  If Cireson has any questions about avoiding any trademark issues, please let me know.

·         In the license for this App, be sure to be clear that Cireson is not claiming copyright on any code or artifacts of this library.  One way to avoid copyright issues, is to not copy any creative elements.

 
ZBAR BARCODE READER
 
·         There’s no problem with using this library as part of a proprietary App although you need to offer to provide the object files upon request.

·         Will Cireson be making any modifications to the library?  See Section 2.6.2 – Please don’t make mods without checking with me

·         Cireson must disclose the use of the library.  Accordingly, if the to-be-developed App is going to be licensed under the SLMA that we just finished wrapping up, we are going to need to revise.  If there is going to be a separate license prepared for this App, be sure to disclose the use of this library.

o   They suggest that the disclosure be something along the lines of:  “The software uses the open source ZBar Barcode Reader library, version 1.2, which is available at http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone

·         Although, it’s not spelled out on the ZBar website, you should also respect any trademark/trade dress rights that ZBar has in their barcode reader.  Make the user interface different, don’t use confusingly similar names or logos.

 
 
Please let me know if you have any further questions.
